# 🍔 3D Food Ordering Platform

I've built a **cutting-edge online food ordering platform** that merges e-commerce with **immersive 3D technology**! This project reimagines how customers interact with food before purchasing — making online ordering more fun, interactive, and realistic.

## 🌟 Key Features

- **🥗 Realistic 3D Food Models**  
  Interact with detailed burgers, drinks, and snacks in real-time using high-quality GLTF assets.

- **🎯 Physics Simulation**  
  Watch food items fall naturally into your virtual box using **Cannon.js** physics.

- **🧩 Immersive Customization**  
  Drag, drop, and arrange items in your box — just like real life.

- **💻 Modern UI**  
  Sleek, responsive, and intuitive interface built with **React** and **Tailwind CSS**.

- **🚀 Seamless 3D Integration**  
  Powered by **React Three Fiber** and `@react-three/drei` for easy and efficient 3D rendering.
